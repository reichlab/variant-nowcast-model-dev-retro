# raw target data

On 11/25/2024, the `src-data-processing/process-raw-data.R` script was run and this downloaded the the "full open" metadata file available at [the Nextstrain SARS-CoV-2 workflow site](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/ncov/en/latest/reference/remote_inputs.html#remote-inputs-open-files), filters it, and saves a CSV version in auxiliary-data/raw-target-data/metadata.csv.
