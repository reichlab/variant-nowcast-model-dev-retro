methods: "A version of our model that has a shared sd between varaiants (sd_structure = F), uses time from start of dataset (time_treatment = D), uses a linear model for time (time_model = L), uses a Dirichlet-multinomial model (distribution = D), and has no spacial elements (spacial_correlation = N), it also assumes that the time coeffients for each variant are drawn from a N(bloc_v, bsd_v^2) distrubution, and bloc_v are idd N(0, 400) and bsd_v are idd draws from a trucated normal(1, 400) distrubution. The intercepts are drawn from a N(aloc_v, asd^2) distrubution, and aloc_v are idd N(0, 400) and asd is a draw from from a trucated normal(1, 400) distrubution. Here the prior on kappa is trucated normal(1,5)."
