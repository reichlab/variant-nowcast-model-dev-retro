methods: "A version of our model that has a shared sd between varaiants (sd_structure = F), uses time from start of dataset (time_treatment = D), uses a linear model for time (time_model = L), uses a multinomial model (distribution = M), and has no spacial elements (spacial_correlation = N), It assumes that the intercepts have iid N(0,6^2) priors, it also assumes that the time coeffients for each variant are drawn from a N(bloc_v, bsd^2) distrubution, and bloc_v are idd N(0, 0.2) and bsd is drawn from a trucated normal(1, 0.1) distrubution."
