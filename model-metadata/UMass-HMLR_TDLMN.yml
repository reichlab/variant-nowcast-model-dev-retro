methods: "A version of our model that sets the knob sd_structure to T, time_treatment to D, time_model to L, distribution to M, and spacial_correlation to N, it also assumes that the time coeffients for each variant are drawn from a N(bloc_v, bsd_v^2) distrubution, and bloc_v are idd N(0, 400) and bsd_v are idd draws from a trucated normal(1, 400) distrubution. The intercepts are drawn from a N(aloc_v, asd_v^2) distrubution, and aloc_v are idd N(0, 400) and asd_v are idd draws from a trucated normal(1, 400) distrubution"
